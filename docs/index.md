# ADG ROS2 Documentation

Welcome to the **Applied Dynamics Group ROS2** documentation! 
This guide covers all the ROS2 packages developed by the McGill Applied Dynamics Group for robotic systems, 
particularly focusing on the Franka Research 3 and teleoperation.

## Overview
The ADG ROS2 ecosystem consists of several interconnected packages:

- **[Robot Arm](packages/robot-arm.md)**: Complete robot arm control system including interfaces, controllers, and bringup
- **[Robot Tasks](packages/robot-tasks.md)**: Task execution framework with reinforcement learning capabilities
- **[Teleop](packages/teleop.md)**: Teleoperation system for remote robot control
- **[ADG ROS2 Utils](packages/adg-ros2-utils.md)**: Core utilities and debugging tools

## Quick Start
